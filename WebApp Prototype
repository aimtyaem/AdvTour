**UX Core Features for Astronaut Health Predictive Analytics System**  
Based on the technical requirements, here’s a streamlined UX design focused on usability, clarity, and actionable insights for diverse user roles (astronauts, medical teams, researchers):

---

### **1. Unified Data Import Dashboard**  
**Goal:** Simplify importing data from diverse sources while ensuring security and validation.  
**Features:**  
- **Multi-Source Integration Panel**  
  - Toggle between data sources: *Sensors*, *Medical Records*, *Research Datasets*, *Manual Entry*.  
  - **Sensor/Device Integration:**  
    - Guided API setup wizard for wearables/implantables (e.g., Fitbit, glucose monitors).  
    - Real-time data stream visualization (e.g., heart rate, radiation exposure).  
  - **Medical Records Upload:**  
    - FHIR/HL7-compliant drag-and-drop interface for EHR systems.  
    - Encryption badges and HIPAA compliance indicators during transfer.  
  - **Research Dataset Import:**  
    - Bulk CSV/Excel upload with auto-validation alerts (e.g., “Missing bone density values detected”).  
    - Metadata tagging tool (study type, demographics, collection dates).  
  - **Manual Entry Forms:**  
    - Context-aware input fields (e.g., dynamic forms for psychological assessments vs. bone density logs).  
    - Inline validation (e.g., “Blood pressure value out of range”).

### **2. AI-Driven Predictive Health Dashboard**  
**Goal:** Deliver real-time, interpretable health risk predictions.  
**Features:**  
- **Personalized Risk Scorecards**  
  - At-a-glance metrics (e.g., “Cardiovascular Risk: Moderate | Bone Loss Risk: High”).  
  - Trend visualizations (line graphs for bone density decay over time).  
- **Explainable AI (XAI) Insights**  
  - Interactive model explanations (e.g., “Radiation exposure contributed 40% to immune dysfunction prediction”).  
  - “Why this prediction?” tooltips with clinical context (e.g., “Low sleep duration + elevated cortisol levels”).  
- **Scenario Simulator**  
  - “What-if” sliders to adjust variables (e.g., increase exercise hours) and see risk recalculations.  
- **Alert System**  
  - Priority notifications (e.g., “Critical: Bone loss rate exceeds safety thresholds”).  
  - Recommended actions (e.g., “Schedule calcium infusion”).

### **3. Data Pipeline & Model Management Hub**  
**Goal:** Empower admins/researchers to manage datasets, AI models, and ETL workflows.  
**Features:**  
- **ETL Process Monitor**  
  - Visual flow diagram showing data ingestion steps (Extract → Clean → Transform → Load).  
  - Error logs with troubleshooting guides (e.g., “HL7 mapping failed: invalid patient ID format”).  
- **AI Model Workshop**  
  - Model selection templates (e.g., “Predict bone loss: Random Forest vs. XGBoost performance”).  
  - Training/evaluation metrics (AUC, precision-recall curves) with comparison charts.  
  - One-click retraining (“Update model with new mission data”).  
- **Database Health Check**  
  - Storage usage analytics (e.g., “PostgreSQL: 85% capacity”).  
  - Query performance optimizer (slow query alerts + indexing suggestions).

### **4. Role-Based Access & Collaboration**  
**Goal:** Tailor views and tools for astronauts, doctors, and data engineers.  
**Features:**  
- **Role-Specific Dashboards**  
  - **Astronauts:** Simplified health summaries + symptom logging (voice-to-text support).  
  - **Medical Teams:** Cohort analysis (e.g., “Compare cardiovascular risks across Mars mission crew”).  
  - **Admins:** System diagnostics + user activity audit logs.  
- **Team Annotation Tools**  
  - Shared notes on predictions (e.g., “Dr. Lee flagged this immune risk for further review”).  
  - Version control for dataset/model iterations.  

---

### **5. Security & Compliance Center**  
**Goal:** Ensure transparency and adherence to privacy standards.  
**Features:**  
- **Data Lineage Tracker**  
  - Visualize data provenance (e.g., “This bone density value originated from ISS Study #X”).  
- **Consent Management**  
  - Granular permissions (e.g., “Astronaut Smith permits sharing exercise data with researchers”).  
- **Compliance Dashboard**  
  - Automated reports for HIPAA/GDPR audits.  
  - Breach detection alerts (e.g., “Unauthorized access attempt blocked”).  

---

### **6. Onboarding & Support**  
**Goal:** Reduce learning curves for non-technical users.  
**Features:**  
- **Interactive Tutorials**  
  - Role-specific walkthroughs (e.g., “Importing wearable data in 3 steps”).  
- **Contextual Help**  
  - AI-powered chatbot (“How do I map FHIR fields to the database?”).  
  - Embedded video demos in complex workflows (e.g., model training).  

---

### **UI Design Principles**  
- **Responsive & Cross-Platform:** Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mission control terminals.  
- **Accessibility:** Dark/light mode, screen-reader compatibility, colorblind-friendly palettes.  
- **Customizable Widgets:** Drag-and-drop dashboard panels for personalized workflows.

This UX framework balances technical complexity with intuitive design, ensuring stakeholders can efficiently import data, interpret AI predictions, and collaborate to safeguard astronaut health. Iterative user testing with astronauts and medical teams will refine edge cases (e.g., microgravity UI interactions).
